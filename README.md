Spritecells
===========

A tool that specifies the size and coordinates
of sprite frames used in animating sprites.


## Notes to self

Using immutable state operations can help
maintain program correctness and thus
should be preferred when effiency isn't the topmost priority,

For instance, the undo/redo would probably have been trivial
and less bug-infested when immutability is used.


## TODO
- Fix undo
- Make interface less crap
- Fix/Improve saving of page state
